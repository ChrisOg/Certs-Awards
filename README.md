# Certs-Awards
Certifications and Awards

In reality, this is just me making sure I know how to do something in order to teach it to someone else. I believe that GitHub repositories are required for our future technical folks.

Thus, I want to show them how to put in scans of certificates, degrees, awards, etc. 

So, this directory is playing around with both text and binary files and getting direct links to them.
